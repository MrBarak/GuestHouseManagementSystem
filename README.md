This project will produce a Desktop application for providing facilities for accommodating customers
and managing the Guest Houses. A Guest House offers accommodation to the paying guests. It is
quite like the Hoteling Systems in which rooms are booked but Guest House provides a mini House
with all facilities that usually holds a house for accommodation besides this, only room renting service
is also handled by this application.
This Application will provide the three interfaces i.e. Customer, Receptionist as well as
Administrators. Customer can use it for booking a Guest House for his/her accommodation whereas
Receptionist can monitor the information about the houses, and rooms in the houses. Application is
quite automated i.e. it manages the system which includes providing housekeeping facility, food
facility, cleaning, laundry and repairing facility. Receptionists deal with the customer complaints, see
customer/employees, modify employee information. Employees are of five categories Receptionists,
Housekeeping, Sweepers, laundryman, repairer. Administrator can add employee, see employee
Update their salaries can see monthly earning with record and can also delete an employee from
record. This application maintains a record for each both kind of customers (those who have left and
those who didnâ€™t).
This application support both the whole mini house and just only rooms to get accommodation
temporally for the Customers.
